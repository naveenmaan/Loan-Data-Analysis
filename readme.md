##### 1. What type of the customer base club's have?
- Club divided the customer in a few ProsperRatings. This rating shows the customer category based on the customer's credit rating and other activities. Which decides whether to lend to the customer on not and if yes then on how much APR. The club has mostly targeted the customer who is in a debt loop and has the medium Prosper Scor and the customer wants the loans for Debt Consolidation and employment but the customer should not have more than 20 Inquiries or Credit lines. Also, customers should not have much debt to income ratio the upper limit for debt to income ratio is 10. Club majority lend to the peoples outside the group for 36 terms plan with an average APR of 0.10- 0.20.

##### 2. What is the customer behaviour?
- Most of the peoples which are in a debt loop have a high debt to income ratio and have fewer Delinquencies history. They tend to pay off their loan before the time period. They also have high Trading and Inquiry history. Which shows that they take the debt on a regular basis. These types of the customer will take the debt with any percentage of principle funding or Borrowing APR.
##### 3. Who give the most profit to the club?
- Clubs get the most of there profit from the customer on how to have a high risk. Which means low credit score, high debt to income ratio, Employed customer. Because these customers have a habit of taking debt or in a debt loop who takes one loan to the pay the other loans and these types of customers can give the club high Borrowing Rate or APR and can leave a part of principle as processing fee.

###### PS. _Debt Loop_ :- Debt loop is when customer takes one loan to pay of the loan or takes loans on ragular basis and paid off the debt before paydate.
